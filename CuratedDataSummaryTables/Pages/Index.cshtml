    <p>
        The Dog Aging Project is an open data project. This user-friendly dashboard provides a dynamic overview of all variables included in the Health and Life Experience Survey. Use the sidebar to navigate to each section of the Health and Life Experience Survey and learn more about the Dog Aging Project Pack.
        Complete and de-identified data about the Dog Aging Project Pack are available publicly through the Terra cloud computing platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The variables summarized here can be directly cross-referenced to the full dataset in Terra. The data presented here are updated regularly.

    <h2 class="home-header">About the Dog Aging Project</h2>
    <p>
        The Dog Aging Project is an innovative initiative that brings together a community of dogs, owners, veterinarians, researchers, and volunteers to carry out the most ambitious canine health study in the world. Our work is centered on two fundamental goals: understanding how biology, lifestyle, and environment influence aging and intervening to increase healthspan, the period of life spent free from disease.
        Our team of 40+ researchers, led by Dr. Daniel Promislow and Dr. Matt Kaeberlein at the University of Washington and Dr. Kate Creevy at Texas A&M, has built a collaborative, open data research platform that harnesses the power of community science, allowing dog owners to participate in scientific research efforts. The Dog Aging Project is supported by U19 grant AG057377 from the National Institute on Aging, a part of the National Institutes of Health, and by private donations.

    <h2 class="home-header">About the Health and Life Experience Survey</h2>
    <p>
        The Health and Life Experience Survey is the foundation for all research conducted by the Dog Aging Project. Available through an individualized research portal, the Health and Life Experience Survey consists of ten sections and asks 200+ questions about lifestyle, environment, behavior and health. Upon completion of the Health and Life Experience Survey, enrolled dogs become members of the research cohort called the Dog Aging Project Pack.
